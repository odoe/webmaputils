# ArcGIS JavaScript WebMap JSON Util
This is a utility for building a map using the Web Map specs with the [ArcGIS JavaScript API](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/).

This is nowhere near complete, but I have been using a similar method of
building my apps from a json configuration file for a while now. I'll add
capabilities to this as I come across the need. The sample also uses a
widgetloader method I have been using happily to build my apps.

# WebMap Specs
Please refer to the following specs for details.
