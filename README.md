# ArcGIS JavaScript WebMapToJSON Util
This is a utility for building a map using WEbMapFromJSON with the [ArcGIS JavaScript API](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/).

This is nowhere near complete, but I have been using a similar method of
building my apps from a json configuration file for a while now. I'll add
capabilities to this as I come across the need. The sample also uses a
widgetloader method I have been using happily to build my apps.
